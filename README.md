# Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem
Customer churn is a major concern for businesses because losing existing customers directly affects revenue. Being able to identify customers who are likely to leave allows companies to take preventive steps such as targeted communication or improved services.

## Approach
In this project, I built a machine learning classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical behavioral and demographic data.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization  
- Scikit-learn for model development  

## Workflow
1. Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and formatting features.
2. Performed exploratory data analysis to understand patterns related to churn.
3. Converted categorical variables into numerical form for modeling.
4. Trained classification models to predict churn probability.
5. Evaluated model performance using standard metrics and confusion matrix analysis.

## Key Takeaway
Customer engagement and tenure were strong indicators of whether a customer would leave.

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand how machine learning is applied to real business problems, especially how preprocessing and feature selection influence model performance.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models such as Gradient Boosting.
- Deploy the model using a simple web interface.
- Perform deeper feature engineering and tuning.
